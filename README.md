# AI-Arduino-Project: Timer & Voice-Controlled Fan

This project is a smart fan system that turns on when a light is activated. When the light is turned on, the system will either display a text prompt or use a voice prompt to ask the user to set a timer for how long the fan should stay on. The fan will automatically turn off when the timer runs out or if the light is turned off before the timer ends.

The goal is to combine basic hardware control with voice interaction to create a more convenient and energy-efficient fan system.
