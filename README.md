# AI-Arduino-Project: Timer & Voice-Controlled Fan

This project is a smart fan system that turns on when a light is activated. When the light is turned on, the system will either display a text prompt or use a voice prompt to ask the user to set a timer for how long the fan should stay on. The fan will automatically turn off when the timer runs out or if the light is turned off before the timer ends.

The goal is to combine basic hardware control with voice interaction to create a more convenient and energy-efficient fan system.
## Requirements (Hardware, Software, and Tools)

Since this project is still in progress, the final list of items may change. Below is a general list of what we expect to use:

### Hardware
- Arduino Mega 2560 (or any compatible Arduino board)
- Fan (DC or AC)
- Relay module (to control the fan)
- Button and LED (to simulate light switch)
- LCD or OLED display (for showing timer prompts)
- Microphone or voice module (for future voice control)
- Temperature sensor (optional)
- Real Time Clock (RTC) module (optional, for scheduling)
- Jumper wires, breadboard, and power supply

### Software / Tools
- Arduino IDE
- Libraries for display, sensors, and timing (TBD based on parts we use)
